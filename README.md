# schneidseven

The theme for my [blog](http://blog.schneidmaster.com/), based on the codebase of [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper).

To get started:

`cd your/ghost/directory`

`cd content/themes`

`git clone git@github.com:schneidmaster/schneidseven.git`

`cd schneidseven`

`npm install`

`grunt prod`

Restart your server (if you're using Passenger, `cd` to your Ghost directory again and `touch tmp/restart.txt`) and the theme should appear in the Ghost admin settings.
